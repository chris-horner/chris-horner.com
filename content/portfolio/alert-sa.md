At [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au), I built the first version of Alert SA Android for the South Australian Government. This was part of a suite of applications we delivered, including an iOS app, website and backend. The service aimed to deliver information and warnings to those living in South Australia, allowing users to browse nearby events and set up watch zones.

This app was the first I designed and developed with Google's [material design](https://design.google.com/) spec in mind. It also allowed me to make use of the latest libraries and tools at the time.

Unfortunately this application is no longer maintained by Gridstone. Development was shifted to a company who offered a lower rate for development and maintenance. Gridstone's suite (including the Android app I built) was replaced wholesale. The service was [ultimately scrapped](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-08/alert-sa-app-scrapped-after-failing-during-serious-bushfire/9310520) after catastrophic issues arose with the new implementation. Perhaps there's a lesson to be learnt about the danger of cutting costs on emergency services.
