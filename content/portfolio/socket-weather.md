Inspired by [Shifty Jelly's](https://blog.shiftyjelly.com/) retired [Pocket Weather](https://blog.shiftyjelly.com/2018/08/31/everything-that-begins-must-also-end/), Socket Weather makes use of a completely undocumented API from Australia's [Bureau of Meteorology](https://weather.bom.gov.au). It's the second app I've designed and built in my spare time, and exists chiefly because I wanted a simple weather app for myself.

From the beginning the app has been [open source](https://github.com/chris-horner/SocketWeather). I hope some of the code and ideas might give inspiration to other Android developers.

The app is currently live on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=codes.chrishorner.socketweather).
