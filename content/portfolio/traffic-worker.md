At [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au), this app was built for a client that specialises in road traffic control and safety. They work with large numbers of contractors with varying availabilities, and needed something to assist with the difficulties they had scheduling work days.

The Android app allowed contractors to mark their availablities, letting admin know exactly what days they were able to work. Jobs were then sent out as push notifications that contractors could accept or reject, letting admin quickly work out if they had a complete roster for a shift.

Unfortunately the app never saw the light of day for use in production, but I was extremely proud of both the design and implementation.
