While working at [Itty Bitty Apps](https://www.ittybittyapps.com/), I joined the team building ANZ Plus - a reimagining of of ANZ's mobile app from the ground up.

My position was on the Enablement team. We drove the architectural direction of the project, along with providing foundational components for feature teams to consume.

The app is currently live on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anz.lotus).
