As part of [Itty Bitty Apps](https://www.ittybittyapps.com/), I was contracted out to assist in maintaining Latitude Financial Service's [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.latitudefinancial.latitudeapp). Here I had to come up to speed quickly on an established codebase and learn to navigate the corporate environment.

I was able to bring a fresh set of eyes to the project. Together with the existing developers, we worked together to overhaul some of the existing technical debt; incrementally improving the codebase while continuing to deliver new features.
