Working with a team of developers and designers at [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au),
Kite was built as an application for lone workers. Users (or their managers) can create a
timed session of work, during which they receive regular notifications requesting that
they check-in. If a user misses a check-in then their location is shared with an
operations centre. From this operations centre, support stuff can manage and escalate
potential safety issues.

This app is ideal for health care workers (who may be visiting with potentially dangerous
patients), or those working alone on hazardous sites.

The app can be
[found in Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.gridstone.kite),
however it requires a licence from Gridstone in order to be used.
