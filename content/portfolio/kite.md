Working with a team of developers and designers at [Gridstone](https://gridstone.com.au), Kite was built as an application for lone workers. Users (or their managers) can create a timed session of work, during which they receive regular notifications requesting that they check-in. If a user misses a check-in then their location is shared with an operations centre. From this operations centre, support stuff can manage and escalate potential safety issues.

This app was ideal for health care workers (who may be visiting with potentially dangerous patients), or those working alone on hazardous sites. Unfortunately the app has been discontinued and removed from Google Play.
