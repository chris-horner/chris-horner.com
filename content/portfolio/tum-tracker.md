Tum Tracker is the first Android application I attempted to build and design on my own. It allows users to keep track of what they've been eating and how they've been feeling. Over time, it provides correlations of foods they've eaten that have made them feel ill.

It's currently a project I work on in my spare time. This means development is slow, but I'm hoping it will see a public release at some point in the future.
