This was the first application I built as a freelance developer rather than with Gridstone. This turned out to be an intense first client (if you're familiar with the scandal at all). Drama and disappointment aside, I was really happy with what I was able to build as a product.

Android apps are often considered as an afterthought to their iOS counterparts. With The Whole Pantry, Alex Benevento led the charge as the iOS developer with [Zane David](https://dribbble.com/zane_david) providing him with dedicated designs. For Android, it was up to me to come up with analogous screens that would feel at home.

I was stoked to have the app win a place in Google's [Beautiful Design Winter 2013](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3000235_beautiful_apps) collection.
