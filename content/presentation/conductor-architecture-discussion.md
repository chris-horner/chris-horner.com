Now that Android has
[Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/),
what relevance does View based navigation library [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor)
have in the world? I think a lot! In this talk I go through what Conductor is, why I like it, and some
architectural patterns I don't mind using when building Android apps.
