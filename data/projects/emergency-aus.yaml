description: Emergency AUS was the first application I developed at [Gridstone](//gridstone.com.au/). Version 2.0 of the application (as seen in the screenshots above) was also my first opportunity to contribute to the design of a project.<br/><br/>The app was built as a joint collaboration between Gridstone and [Ripe Intelligence](https://ripeintel.info/) to deliver real time information and alerts to people around Australia. It was a massive undertaking considering the experience I had at the time, and forced me to learn the ins and outs of Android development.<br/><br/>These days, the app is looking a little dated with its [Holo era](http://android-developers.blogspot.com.au/2012/01/holo-everywhere.html) design. Hopefully that will change soon. For an idea of what's be coming, check out [Alert SA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.gov.alert.sa).
